== Description

A Riemann client for ruby

Just another client, to experiment with.

== Requirements

* A riemann server to talk to

== Installation

gem install riemann-ruby-experiments

== Use

Include the following line in your Gemfile:

  gem 'riemann-ruby-experiments'

Then, you can use it like this:

  client = Riemann::Experiment::Client.new(server: "localhost:5555", service: "A new riemann logger!")
  e1 = {time: Time.now.to_i,
       description: "An event of some sort",
       metric: 42.15,
       anotherkey: "anothervalue"}
  client.add_event(e1)

  e2 = {time: Time.now.to_i, description: "Another event", metric: 73}
  client.add_event(e2)

  response = client.send_message()

  if response.ok == 'ok'
    # acknowledged by server...
  end

You can also send queries to the Riemann server:

  client = Riemann::Experiment::Client.new()
  events = client['service = "http/head/mysite"']
  puts events.first.roundtrip

New attributes can be assigned to an `Riemann::Experiment::Event` object as though
they were defined on the object with simple attr_accessors.  To create events
yourself, make sure to call `setup()` on them, passing the client, before doing
other manipulations (and especially before serializing) in order to make sure
that client-wide default values are applied correctly.

  e = Riemann::Experiment::Event.new
  e.setup(client)
  e.time = Time.now
  e.website = "http://example.com/"
  Base64.strict_encode64(e)  # Just for illustration:
    => "CKyWs7oFGiMuL3JpZW1hbm4tcnVieS1leHBlcmltZW50cy5yYjsxMDU4NyIFdGh5bWVKHgoHd2Vic2l0ZRITaHR0cDovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tLw=="

For most purposes, though, it's easier to just pass a hash of field values to
the client's `add_event()` and let it take care of the details.
